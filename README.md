Detecting fake job postings using machine learning with EDA, model training, and deployment-ready notebooks.

# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake Job Post Detection Using Machine Learning

This project tackles the challenge of detecting **fraudulent job postings** using machine learning. Fake job advertisements are increasingly used to scam job seekers. By analyzing patterns in job data, this project builds a model that predicts whether a job posting is **real** or **fake** with high accuracy.

The project includes **data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model training**, and an optional deployment notebook. It is designed for both academic understanding and practical use cases.
